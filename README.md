Deep Learning is the path to AI.
-----------------------------------

There has been a surge in the application of AI. More and more companies are adopting AI, and they need talent with knowledge of machine learning and deep learning. Companies are paying high salaries for people with such skills. ML and DL stand for the first and second most demanded jobs in 2019, and ML is the highest-paid job. The other tops are closely related to ML and DL, such as data scientists and computer vision engineers. In this digital world, there is an immense abundance of data that can be used. There has never been a better time to walk into the field of AI through learning ML and DL.

Researching and applying ML/DL is a hot field that requires a certain understanding of a specific set of knowledge. Depending on which path (researching or applying) is chosen, the depth of understanding might differ. However, for beginners, some essential skills could significantly quicken learning and comprehension.

-----------------------------------
Core requirements:
- Math skills
  - Derivatives The heart of a deep learning algorithm lies in the foundation of chain rules.
  - MatrixLinear algebra is a quick and efficient way of handling large and structured data.
  - Statistics At this moment, AI is built on data; a lot of it. a tremendous amount of data. Information needs to be analyzed and structured before being learned by ML or DL also.
- Programming skills:
  - Having a good understanding of certain languages will only help you learn ML or DL.
    - The top choices are Python, R, Java, C++, Lisp, etc.
  - A framework for artificial intelligence Knowing these languages is not enough. Getting comfortable with one or more AI frameworks will boost productivity incredibly.
    - The top choices include Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras, DL4J, and others. Additionally, skills such as researching, working in a group, communicating, technical writing, presenting, self-organizing, and so on are unquestionably valuable.

 Course:
 
- Coursera, EDX, and Udemy are excellent platforms for general learning, not just ML/DL.
    - [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specification Course series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesDLSTopButton).
    - [Data Science: Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-machine-learning?index=product&queryID=fec6a9fc4256d7c78a57f3d4ebb69d85&position=1)
    - [Deep Learning A-Ztm](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)
    - [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesTFSTopButton)
       
Courses on Coursera and EDX have an "audit" option that allows one to learn from the classes without assignments and, therefore, a certificate. However, the price is rather low for the intensive knowledge that is being taught. For further and more structured courses, visit [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai).

Online Books:

Career Path:
The career path of DL/ML is various. There are many subfields that build up DL/ML. If pay is the goal, starting as ML engineer is a fascinating option. As any supervised AI system requires an enormous amount of data, Data Scientist is an great choice as it is the second most paid after ML Engineer. DL comes after those twos. Companies demands engineers with DL skills such as computational linguist, NPL, speech recognition, Image processing, etc. 
All of the jobs requires a deep understanding of Math skills such as calculus and linear algebra. In order to apply those skills, ones is compulsory to be proficient in a certain programming language like Python, Rust, C++, etc. To step up, Ones must be trained and fluent in some ML/DL frameworks such as Tensorflow, Caffe, Pytorch, etc. On the way of learning these frameworks(or even before), focus on aquire DL/ML algorithm. To set a firm impression on all of these knowledge, challenge yourself with some of your ideas, reapply some well-known models, try to collect and analyze data, etc.
Poccessing these skills and well honing them will open wide doors to a great number of door to DL/ML jobs.
