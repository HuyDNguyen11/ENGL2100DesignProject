Deep Learning, the path to AI.
------------------------------------
AI is a skyrocketing field. There are huge demands for AI related jobs, such as ML engineers, and DL engineers. ML/DL is the two most highest paid jobs in IT field, in average.

Unlike traditional programs that require almost entire hand-code features, ML/DL programs attain those features by learning those skills themselves through a certain amount of pre-labeled data. 

Besides the requirements for data management, ML/DL programming requires less hand-code skills. What is necesarry for a beginner is a good programming skills(somewhat familiar with certain languages such python, java, c++,..) and some good calculus skills, mostly derivatives, which can be handled by frameworks, but is compulsary for deeper grasp of the knowledge.
