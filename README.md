Deep Learning, the path to AI.
------------------------------------
There has been a surge in the application of AI. More and more companies are adopting AI, and they are in need for talents with knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Companies are paying high for people with such skills. In fact, ML/DL stands the first and second most demanded jobs in 2019, and ML is the highest pay-job.The other tops are closely related to ML/DL such as Data scientist, Computer Vision engineers. In this digital world, there is a immensely abundance amount of data that can be used. It has never been a better time to walk into the field of AI through learning ML and DL. 

Researching and Applying ML/DL is a hot field that requires certain understanding of specific set of knowledge. Depending on which path(researching or applying) that the depth of understanding might differ. However, for beginners, there are some essential skills that could significantly help ones learn and understand quickly.
------------------------------------

Core requirements:
- Math skills
  - Derivative. The heart of a Deep Learning algorithm lies on the foundation of chain rules.
  - Linear algebra. Matrix is the quick and efficient way of handling large and structured data.
  - Statistics. At this moment, AI is built on data, a lot of, a tremendous lot of data. Information needs to be analized and structured before learnt by ML/DL algo.       


- Programming skills:
  - A decent knowledge of certain languages will only beneficially help one learn ML/DL. 
    - Top choices are Python, R, Java, C++, Lisp, etc.
  - An AI framework. Knowing these these languages is not enough, getting comfortable with one or more AI frameworks will boost the productivity incredably. 
    - Top choices are Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, DL4J, etc.
- Besides, Skills such as researching, working in group, communicating, techincal writing, presenting, self-organizing, etc. surely are invaluable.    

------------------------------------

Courses:
- Coursera, edX, udemy are great platform for studying not just ML/DL. Eg:
  - [Deep Learning Specification](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesDLSTopButton) is a course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.
  - [Data Science: Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-machine-learning?index=product&queryID=fec6a9fc4256d7c78a57f3d4ebb69d85&position=1)
  - [Deep Learning A-Ztm](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)
Disclaimer: Courses on Coursera and edX have "audit" option that allows one to learn from the classes without assigments and therefore certificate. However, the price is rather low for the intensive knowledge what is being taught. For further and more structured courses, visit [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/programs/).
